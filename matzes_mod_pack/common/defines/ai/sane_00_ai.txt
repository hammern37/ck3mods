	MIN_PATH_COST_TO_CONSIDER_WATER_PATH = 180			# Number of travel days before AI considers searching for a path across water instead
	MIN_PATH_COST_SAVINGS_TO_CONSIDER_WATER_PATH = 120	# Number of travel days saved before AI considers going through water instead

	## Men-at-Arms Logic Changes 
	#When buying/disbanding MaA, these mults are used to figure out the score. Note that the score is divided by cost^2 (adjusted for realm size, full impact at realm size 1, linear impact at realm size 12+), and multiplied by stack size (except for siege value, which is only divided by cost)
	TOUGHNESS_SCORE_MULT = 10
	ATTACK_SCORE_MULT = 10
	PURSUIT_SCORE_MULT = 2
	SCREEN_SCORE_MULT = 1 
	SIEGE_VALUE_SCORE_MULT = 1000
	NEGATIVE_SCORE_PER_EXISTING_REGIMENT = 0				# Was 20. How much is the score of the regiment type reduced per existing subregiment of that type? Bullshit. Removed. Caused the AI to go polygamy.
	RANDOM_REGIMENT_SCORE_MAX = 0.0							# How much extra score can the AI randomly give to this regiment? Will always be the same for the same character + regiment. 0.2 means 0-20% extra. Vanilla 0.2. Causes it to hire objectively worse MAA. Removed.
	NORMAL_SUB_REGIMENTS_PER_SIEGE_SUB_REGIMENT = 5			# How many non-siege regiments should there be for each siege regiment? Siege will always be the first sub-regiment purchased, and the AI will maintain this ratio.
	SUBTRACT_NORMAL_SUB_REGIMENTS_FOR_SIEGE_PURPOSES = 12	# Was 3. Ignore this many normal regiments when buying siege sub-regiments. This effectively means the AI will buy their first siege weapon after this many normal ones, and then one more for every NORMAL_SUB_REGIMENTS_PER_SIEGE_SUB_REGIMENT additional normal sub-regiments
	REGIMENT_OBSOLETION_SCORE_DIFFERENCE = 10				# Was 20. The AI will disband a regiment if it is this much worse than the best available regiment, and it is unable to hire more regiments (due to cost or being at cap). Quick math: 10 damage * 100 men / 200 cost = 5 score difference.

	MEN_AT_ARMS_REALM_SIZE_FOR_COST_EFFECTIVENESS_START = 1	# Was 5. At realm sizes of this and below, men at arms score is divided by cost^2.
	MEN_AT_ARMS_REALM_SIZE_FOR_COST_EFFECTIVENESS_END = 12	# Was 50. At realm sizes after this, men at arms quality score is divided by cost^1. Between the two values, interpolate.

	MEN_AT_ARMS_EXPENSE_GOAL = 0.5						# Was 0.4 The AI will try to spend this much of its income on MAA maintenance
	MEN_AT_ARMS_EXPENSE_MAX = 0.7						# Was 0.6 The AI will disband MAA if it ends up spending more than this amount of its income on maintenance
	
	MEN_AT_ARMS_CHANCE_EXPENSE_ZERO = 0.5				# Was 1. Chance the AI will prefer MaA to buildings when spending nothing on MaA
	MEN_AT_ARMS_CHANCE_EXPENSE_MIN = 0					# Was 0.2. Chance the AI will prefer MaA to buildings when spending the goal amount on MaA. Between the two values, interpolate.
	
	MAX_RAID_DAYS = 400 ### After this long, the AI will go home when a raid action concludes. Was 365. Needs a little extra because of slower sailing speed.
	
	STAND_AND_FIGHT_DAYS = 12 ## Was 30.
	RETREAT_COMBAT_PREDICTION_RATIO = 0.5 ## Was 0.45
	
	## Base Agressiveness Reduction
	AI_BASE_WAR_CHANCE = 0.2								# Was 0.5. Basic chance of declaring war. Further reduced by energy; x0 at -100, x1 at 100, x0.5 at 0 energy. Should help with economy and make wars that do happen more meaningful.

	## Fixed RNG AI Building Logic. Build the best thing dammit!
	BUILDING_MIN_SCORE_COMPARED_TO_BEST = 1 # Was 0.8. Nope, removed. Is actually 0.65 in the "Better AI" mod... wtf. Its not about building more, its about building the right thing.
