 VIETold.0000.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETold.0001.t:0 "Night Sky"
 VIETold.0001.desc:0 "Tonight the night sky is clear, and you can see every single star shining in the sky like jewels on a fine, black dress. What wonder can be found in heaven"s creation! What magic! You have a rare moment of peace in yourself as you admire the night sky."
 VIETold.0001.a:0 "Amazing."
 VIETold.0002.t:0 "The Butterfly"
 VIETold.0002.desc:0 "A butterfly landed on my arm. It looks so harmless, just fluttering its wings, unaware of my existence."

 VIETold.0002.b:0 "Shake it off."
 VIETold.0002.c:0 "Smash and kill it!"
 VIETold.0003.t:0 "The Scorpion"
 VIETold.0003.desc:0 "I've just made a quick trip to one of the local oases. While resting with my entourage on the journey back, I fail to notice a scorpion nearby - I accidentally irritate it, and it stings me hard! My men quickly dispose of the creature while I squirm in pain."
 VIETold.0003.a:0 "Ow! Ow!"
 VIETold.0004.t:0 "Happy Dream"
 VIETold.0004.desc:0 "Night falls, and I quickly asleep as I rest in my bed. In my dreams, I see a great light, an impenetrable, heavenly light. I know not what it is, or even what it represents, but something about it brings me peace and happiness..."
 VIETold.0004.a:0 "Is it... a sign from the heavens?"
 VIETold.0005.t:0 "Field of Battle"
 VIETold.0005.desc:0 "The cries of fighting men, the splatter of red blood, the clashing of weapons everywhere... I scream and shout in my dream, unaware of my surroundings, of who is my friend and who is my enemy, swinging my sword without regard, lost in my battlerage and the hellish terror that is battle."
 VIETold.0005.a:0 "DIE! DIE!"
 VIETold.0006.t:0 "You Have Been Chosen"
 VIETold.0006.desc:0 "In my dream, I see a tall figure with a golden mask approach, coming closer, and closer, and closer... And then, I am suddenly awakened by my servant. "Wake Up. We're here. Are you ok? Wake up. Stand up. There you go. You were dreaming.""
 VIETold.0006.a:0 "What was that..."
 VIETold.0007.t:0 "The Roman Empire - Restored!"
 VIETold.0007.desc:0 "I stand before your people, basking in glory, arms outstretched.\n\n"Rome is restored!" I proclaim, to the cheers of the crowds.\n\nAnd just as it quickly started, the dream ended, and I wake up.\n\n"That was a good dream," I mutter to myself. "If only it were true...""
 VIETold.0007.a:0 "Long live Rome..."
 VIETold.0008.t:0 "Splash!"
 VIETold.0008.desc:0 "A big splash, and I fall into the mud. Dammit! If only it didn’t rain this morning. Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to take a stroll outside, after all. I stand up, trying to wipe the mud off my ruined clothes."
 VIETold.0008.a:0 "Curses!"
 VIETold.0008.b:0 "'tis but the doing of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to humble me."
 VIETold.0009.t:0 "A Shiny Find"
 VIETold.0009.desc:0 "While strolling outside one day, I stop to relieve myself. As I finish, I notice a bit of gleaming on the ground. Careful to not step on my urine, I move towards the shiny object, and realize that it is a gold coin."
 VIETold.0009.a:0 "What luck!"
 VIETold.0010.t:0 "The Best Fertilizer?"
 VIETold.0010.desc:0 "Today I’m visiting some of the local peasants. Inquiring about their farming practices, one of the peasant men told me about how they are debating the usage of various fertilizers. “My lord, frankly, I’m not sure which one would help yield a better harvest - urine, feces, or dead plants.”"
 VIETold.0010.a:0 "Don’t talk such rot, you filthy peasant!"
 VIETold.0010.b:0 "Urine seems cleaner to me..."
 VIETold.0010.c:0 "Feces. It looks like dirt, maybe it’d work better with dirt?"
 VIETold.0010.d:0 "Dead plants make the most sense to me."
 VIETold.0011.t:0 "Manuscript Ink"
 VIETold.0011.desc:0 "I’m observing some of the local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] at work studying dense and arcane ancient texts. Suddenly, one of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] says, “Oh dear, this manuscript won’t do at all. The colors of the illustrations aren’t good.”\n\nPerhaps I should suggest a better source of pigment to illustrate the manuscript."
 VIETold.0011.a:0 "Earwax, I’ve heard, makes the best pigment."
 VIETold.0011.b:0 "Many have told me urine really brings out the vibrant colors."
 VIETold.0011.c:0 "Try looking for colorful stones to grind, is what I've been told."
 VIETold.0011.a.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Earwax was useful as a binding medium when mixed with various powdered substances to create pigments."
 VIETold.0011.b.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Urine was often mixed with other materials to make certain kinds of colored pigments."
 VIETold.0011.c.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Colorful stones - particularly precious ones like lapis lazuli - have always been used as a source for colorful pigments."
 VIETold.0012.t:0 "The Colorful Stool"
 VIETold.0012.desc:0 "I overhear one of my courtiers complaining about how, as of late, their feces has turned strange colors, like green. Then again, this courtier is known for being a complete pig at times, so who knows what sort of foods caused this amusing circumstance?"
 VIETold.0012.a:0 "That's what you get for eating too much food!"
 VIETold.0012.b:0 "I suspect that you might have too much bile in your body."
 VIETold.0013.t:0 "Lazy Cook"
 VIETold.0013.desc:0 "Today, ,my personal cook prepared yet another meal by boiling. Remembering the derisive Roman maxim, “The lazy cook prepares everything by boiling,” I decide I might as well ask my cook why he is so lazy. Trying to look intimidating as possible, I approach the cook and tell him..."
 VIETold.0013.a:0 "Don’t be lazy! If you work hard, everyone will appreciate it."
 VIETold.0013.b:0 "Some might care, but personally, I think it’s fine you’re being lazy."
 VIETold.0013.c:0 "Cook different foods! Maybe with garum or kefalintzin cheese?"
 VIETold.0013.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Garum was a fermented fish sauce that was first used among various civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean, including the Romans and Carthaginians, and it survived into the medieval period in Byzantine and Arab cuisine. Kefalintzin was a type of cheese reputedly eaten in the Byzantine Empire."
 VIETold.0014.t:0 "Vanity!"
 VIETold.0014.desc:0 "Today, a merchant from one of the eastern Mediterranean realms is visiting my household. To our utter shock, the man insisted that his servants cut the food up into pieces and then eating the pieces with this thing called a “fork”. These foreign manners are nothing but sheer vanity!"
 VIETold.0014.a:0 "Indeed! This is a mark of pride."
 VIETold.0014.b:0 "We should respect different customs, even if they are rather arrogant."
 VIETold.0014.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Although forks had been found in Europe (particularly the Roman Empire) since ancient times, the personal table fork only gained popularity in the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East during the early medieval period. The rest of Europe was slow to adopt the fork at first, seeing it as a symbol of excess and vanity, and in some places in Europe it wasn't even until the 18th century that personal forks became widespread."
 VIETold.0015.t:0 "Sour Kefir"
 VIETold.0015.desc:0 "It was supposed to be a delicious cup of kefir but it turned out to be too sour. It appears it wasn’t preserved that well, and now you’re feeling a bit sick."
 VIETold.0015.a:0 "Oh, my stomach’s revolting..."
 VIETold.0015.b:0 "I think someone’s trying to kill me!"
 VIETold.0015.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Kefir is a fermented milk drink and tastes somewhat like a thick liquid yogurt. It originated in the Caucasus region and later spread to neighboring cultures."
 VIETold.0016.t:0 "North African Mint Tea"
 VIETold.0016.desc:0 "Today, one of my vassals is visiting me. As custom dictates, I must prepare the traditional North African mint tea for my guest in a simple ceremony as a sign of my hospitality.\n\nThankfully, I manage to complete the ceremony with no blunders."
 VIETold.0016.a:0 "My vassal seems to appreciate it."
 VIETold.0017.t:0 "Nomad Pit Stop"
 VIETold.0017.desc:0 "While traveling to one of your faraway holdings, you must stop for a meal. You find a “guanz”, a ger or nomad tent used on the nomad steppes as a mobile restaurants as sorts. The owner of the guanz asks you what sort of meat would you like."
 VIETold.0017.a:0 "Horse meat, please."
 VIETold.0017.b:0 "Mutton is what I want."
 VIETold.0017.c:0 "Goat testicles sound good."
 VIETold.0017.d:0 "Dumplings filled with meat, onions, and garlic, yes!"
 VIETold.0017.e:0 "Barley porridge mixed with milk fat."

 VIETold.1001.t:0 "Onion Gift"
 VIETold.1001.desc:0 "One of my servants came back today after visiting a cousin living in a town some distance away. This cousin had kindly offered some precious onions as a gift."
 VIETold.1001.a:0 "Thank you! These would go great in soup."
 VIETold.1002.t:0 "Red and Yellow Carrots?"
 VIETold.1002.desc:0 "I met an interesting, perhaps slightly crazy traveler today. He claims to have seen red and yellow carrots in a faraway land! Ha ha! What a good joke. Everyone can see carrots are purple. Even if there were such things as red and yellow carrots, no one would want such outlandish colors for their carrots."
 VIETold.1002.a:0 "What next, orange carrots?"
 VIETold.1002.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! For much of history, the most common color of carrots was purple. Red and yellow carrots begin to appear during the medieval period, while orange carrots came about during the early modern period."
 VIETold.1003.t:0 "Their Cabbages!"
 VIETold.1003.desc:0 "One of my courtiers has lately refused to eat anything with cabbage. When questioned why, I was told: "Cabbage? Oh dear... you know it is peasant's food - it is like water to them. Why would a person of high status such as ourselves consume such a lowly, filthy plant?""
 VIETold.1003.a:0 "A good point!"
 VIETold.1003.b:0 "What an extreme attitude."
 VIETold.1003.c:0 "Let me guess - you are going to avoid water too?"
 VIETold.1004.t:0 "Hair Loss Treatment"
 VIETold.1004.desc:0 "As I get older, I'm starting to lose some hair. My doctor prescribed onions as a way to combat this problem. The medicinal properties of onion, he said, would help me on this situation."
 VIETold.1004.a:0 "My breath will smell really bad after this..."
 VIETold.1005.t:0 "Living Undead?"
 VIETold.1005.desc:0 "Rumors abound that several demons or evil spirits of some sort have recently habituated themselves near my residence. I have seen the commoners living nearby start to hang garlic on their windows in order to protect themselves."
 VIETold.1005.a:0 "I should do the same to protect myself."
 VIETold.1005.b:0 "Those gullible, superstitious fools..."
 VIETold.1006.t:0 "Greek Salad"
 VIETold.1006.desc:0 "I'm in the mood for some salad. They say it reminds one of the peaceful Greek countryside, and I feel like I need to relax after a stressful day of business. What better than a refreshing mix of fresh vegetables and mouthwatering cheese and dressing?"
 VIETold.1006.a:0 "I'll go ask my cook to prepare some salad."
 VIETold.1007.t:0 "Water Danger"
 VIETold.1007.desc:0 "I drank some water and choked on it. Thankfully a servant saved me, but my court witnessed the entire embarrassing situation."
 VIETold.1007.a:0 "A frightening experience!"
 VIETold.1008.t:0 "Aaaah..."
 VIETold.1008.desc:0 "After a stressful day, drinking some fresh, cool water is so relaxing."
 VIETold.1008.a:0 "Aaaahhh..."
 VIETold.1009.t:0 "Dry Wells"
 VIETold.1009.desc:0 "The wells used by your court for water have dried up. It is time to dig up new ones, and soon, or else everyone at the court will die of thirst!"
 VIETold.1009.a:0 "Send the men to find a new well."
 VIETold.1010.t:0 "Chicory Treatment"
 VIETold.1010.desc:0 "I tripped and fell down on the stairs! Thank heavens I'm okay - I just have a few bruises. My physician, [physician.GetTitledFirstName] said I should treat it with chicory, which I hate because of its bitter taste. Though I won't be eating it, and only applying it on the affected skin, having to deal with it is just annoying."
 VIETold.1010.a:0 "But I don't want my bruises to get worse."
 VIETold.1010.message:0 "The Chicory treatment did not help significantly"
 VIETold.1011.t:0 "Bitter Greens"
 VIETold.1011.desc:0 "Since I rule over a population traditionally inhabited by Hellenic peoples, I get to eat quite a lot of Greek food. I've found that the locals love eating khorta, or greens, a bitter mix of plants and herbs. It is extremely bitter though. I don't know if I can ever get used to it..."
 VIETold.1011.a:0 "Bitter foods can be tasty!"
 VIETold.1011.b:0 "Forget this Greek filth!"
 VIETold.1012.t:0 "Sugar Or No Sugar?"
 VIETold.1012.desc:0 "Coffee. No [ROOT.Culture.GetName] [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] can live without it, myself included. It is a natural part of our diet. Most drink it bitter, but some make it sweet by adding sugar."
 VIETold.1012.a:0 "I prefer my coffee bitter, as is custom."
 VIETold.1012.b:0 "Sweet coffee is better. Without it it's too bitter."
 VIETold.1013.t:0 "A Poor Purchase"
 VIETold.1013.desc:0 "Bitter! Olives can't be this bitter, who can eat them? How will anyone make olive oil? It seems the stock of olives I bought were too raw."
 VIETold.1013.a:0 "What a waste."
 VIETold.1014.t:0 "Stimulating Vegetables"
 VIETold.1014.desc:0 "I've eaten a lot of arugula lately in my salads. No wonder I've been feeling so... stimulated in certain ways. People say it's an aphrodisiac after all."
 VIETold.1014.a:0 "Good! Maybe this will last a long time..."
 VIETold.1014.b:0 "I should eat cabbages, which will calm me down."
 VIETold.1014.a.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the past, ancient and medieval learned men believed that arugula was an aphrodisiac. For instance, it is mentioned in the love poetry of Virgil and Ovid."
 VIETold.1014.b.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! During the medieval period, to counter the supposed aphrodisiac qualities of arugula, it was often mixed with cabbage, which was believed to have calming qualities."
 VIETold.1015.t:0 "I Eat My Spinach"
 VIETold.1015.desc:0 "Spinach may taste bitter, but I eat it because I've found it makes me feel healthier and stronger. (I've heard rumors of a less bitter spinach in faraway lands, though.)"
 VIETold.1015.a:0 "I'm strong to the finish because I eat my spinach!"
 VIETold.1016.t:0 "A New Fad"
 VIETold.1016.desc:0 "A new cosmetic popular among the noblewomen is made using the egg yolk of from quail eggs instead of the usual chicken eggs. But quail eggs are a rare luxury much more suited for gourmet food. Are these women truly vain?"
 VIETold.1016.a:0 "A useless product!"
 VIETold.1016.b:0 "I could've eaten those eggs..."
 VIETold.1016.c:0 "This does not concern me. The fad will pass in time."
 VIETold.1016.d:0 "I think it looks nice on me!"
 VIETold.1017.t:0 "Egged"
 VIETold.1017.desc:0 "Yesterday there was a local traditional festival that is held annually in the city. During the night, while everyone was busy celebrating, some drunk and inconsiderate revelers dared to egg the house of a merchant friend of mine!"
 VIETold.1017.a:0 "Maybe those hooligans were sent by his business rivals?"
 VIETold.1018.t:0 "Pickled Eggs Galore"
 VIETold.1018.desc:0 "Yesterday I went to the local tavern and had too much beer. While drunk I ordered a large amount of pickled eggs to eat with my beer, as I usually do. However, this time, in my drunkeness I must have taken and paid for all the pickled eggs the tavern had. Now do I not only have to deal with my hangover, I have to figure out what to do with these eggs."
 VIETold.1018.a:0 "Looks like we'll be eating pickled eggs for a while..."
 VIETold.1018.a.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Pickling was and is a common and delicious way to preserve food historically and in the present-day in many cultures. Pickled eggs have been eaten all over Eurasia, and were - and are - often common luxury snacks."
 VIETold.1019.t:0 "Shell Shock"
 VIETold.1019.desc:0 "Today I visited one of my vassals, [scope_VIET_eggshell_vassal.GetTitledFirstName]. While there, we dined on a delicious sponge cake... or, at least, it was delicious until both of us nearly choked on eggshells. Now my vassal is highly embarrassed by [scope_VIET_eggshell_vassal.GetHerHis] cook's incompetency at cooking with eggs."
 VIETold.1019.a:0 "And [scope_VIET_eggshell_vassal.GetSheHe] should be!"
 VIETold.1019.b:0 "It's no matter, things happen all the time."
 VIETold.1020.t:0 "Deviled Eggs"
 VIETold.1020.desc:0 "For dinner tonight I'll be having deviled eggs. What should be stuffed in these eggs, I wonder? My cook will make them taste good regardless of what's inside them."
 VIETold.1020.a:0 "Vegetables. Who says abstaining from excess isn't delicious?"
 VIETold.1020.b:0 "Meat. I want something to strengthen me!"
 VIETold.1020.c:0 "Milk, cream, or cheese. It shall taste richer and fatten me well."
 VIETold.1021.t:0 "A New Wardrobe"
 VIETold.1021.desc:0 "It's time for me to buy a new wardrobe, somewhere to put my favorite clothes. My old one is worn out and will likely fall apart any day now. What sort of wardrobe should I get? A person of status such as myself can afford a decent wardrobe made of good quality wood, at any rate."
 VIETold.1021.a:0 "A simple one will do."
 VIETold.1021.b:0 "Something nice, a bit stylish, but not too much."
 VIETold.1021.c:0 "It needs to be extravagant - with gold leaf, and intricate carving everywhere!"
 VIETold.1022.t:0 "A Bad Chair"
 VIETold.1022.desc:0 "Aaahh!"\n\nThe chair you were sitting on broke, and you fell to the ground, looking like a clown."
 VIETold.1022.a:0 "Why is this happening to me?"
 VIETold.1022.message:0 "You got injured from falling down the chair"
 VIETold.1023.t:0 "Under the Table"
 VIETold.1023.desc:0 "There's nothing much to do while I'm waiting for my food at the dinner table. Out of curiosity, I glance under the table you sit at.\n\nI almost puke as you see some disgusting mess - partly crusty and dried up, partly still icky and goopy - sticking to the underside of the table. Who in the blazes put that there?\n\nWhat is that, anyways, to begin with?"
 VIETold.1023.a:0 "Servants! I need you to clean up something!"
 VIETold.1024.t:0 "Time to Clean Up?"
 VIETold.1024.desc:0 "My desk is a mess! Papers, quills, ink, maps, charts, and other important things are strewn all over.\n\nMaybe it would be a good time to clean up this mess? Then again, it's not like it's something I need to do. After all, I've gotten by with this mess and I can always do it another day."
 VIETold.1024.a:0 "It bothers me! I should organize this mess."
 VIETold.1024.b:0 "Nah, no need to do anything."
 VIETold.1025.t:0 "Keeping Time"
 VIETold.1025.desc:0 "A lesser nobleman in my realm gave me an hourglass as a gift. It should help me keep track of time."
 VIETold.1025.a:0 "Thank you!"
 VIETold.1026.t:0 "Overslept"
 VIETold.1026.desc:0 "Oh no! I overslept and was late to this morning's meeting with my advisors!"
 VIETold.1026.a:0 "Why didn't the servants wake me on time?"
 VIETold.1027.t:0 "Efficient Timekeeper"
 VIETold.1027.desc:0 "One of my newest personal servants is a diligent fellow, determined even. He always makes sure I do things on time - it pays to have a servant like him!"
 VIETold.1027.a:0 "Indeed."
 VIETold.1028.t:0 "Village Fire"
 VIETold.1028.desc:0 "A big fire broke out in a peasant village uncomfortably close to my residence. Thankfully the local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] had a water clock so large it had enough water to douse the flames."
 VIETold.1028.a:0 "Thank goodness everything's fine."
 VIETold.1028.b:0 "We must help those poor peasants!"
 VIETold.1029.t:0 "Noontime Sun"
 VIETold.1029.desc:0 "The sun is high above - it's noontime, isn't it? And it is rather hot outside. I've been out for a bit too long doing whatever business I was doing, and I'm starting to feel a little light-headed."
 VIETold.1029.a:0 "Better retreat inside into the shade, maybe drink some water too."
 VIETold.1029.b:0 "I have some business to finish, unfortunately!"

 VIETold.2000.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETold.2001.t:0 "Through the Valleys"
 VIETold.2001.desc:0 "When I fell asleep and traveled to the land of dreams, I found myself on a vast hill of the greenest grass, overlooking a great lake surrounding a mighty city. Below the hill was an ancient marble shrine, while behind me was a small cottage beside a forest, where birds whistled and the trees whispered comfort in my ear. I rested for a while before I decided to..."
 VIETold.2001.a:0 "Walk down the hill, to see the lake."
 VIETold.2001.b:0 "See the shrine to pay my respects."
 VIETold.2001.c:0 "Explore the forest."
 VIETold.2001.d:0 "Enter the cottage and relax."
 VIETold.2002.t:0 "Harvest Dawn"
 VIETold.2002.desc:0 "I emerge from my residence early in the morning to travel to an important noble's residence some distance from here. Along the way, as the sun slowly crept upwards into the sky, I pass by several villages. Peasants scatter themselves in the fields, working with their crops, though they always stop to pay their respects to me."
 VIETold.2002.a:0 "Good to see all is in order."
 VIETold.2002.b:0 "Those commoners scare me!"
 VIETold.2002.c:0 "I want to ask some of them about how things are going."
 VIETold.2003.t:0 "King and Country"
 VIETold.2003.desc:0 "I realize that there must have been many rulers who came before me, lesser lords and ladies, as well as mighty kings and queens, who once ruled this country. Many of them I will never know. Will I, too, be forgotten one day, not even a footnote in a history book nor even a faint whisper in the wind?"
 VIETold.2003.a:0 "Even if I die, what matters is if I did my duty."
 VIETold.2003.b:0 "I will do great deeds to ensure my immortality!"
 VIETold.2003.c:0 "As long as I'm happy, then I am fine with whatever happens."
 VIETold.2003.d:0 "Nothing matters in the end. Why do I even try?"
 VIETold.2004.t:0 "Wings of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 VIETold.2004.desc:0 "I am in another dream again - this time, I am flying in the sky, looking over a realm of grassy pastures and green forests. There are so many places I can go to, yet one place calls to me, one place where I can't resist exploring:"
 VIETold.2004.a:0 "The pale, white temple to the north..."
 VIETold.2004.b:0 "The cosmopolitan trade port to the west..."
 VIETold.2004.c:0 "The mysterious, dark swamp to the south..."
 VIETold.2004.d:0 "The vast flower fields to the east..."
 VIETold.2005.t:0 "All's Well"
 VIETold.2005.desc:0 "Today was a very quiet and boring day at court. Nothing exciting happened."
 VIETold.2005.a:0 "Excitement isn't always desirable, so I'm glad."
 VIETold.2005.b:0 "I want excitement! I want to live life!"
 VIETold.2005.a.tooltip:0 "People always say they want excitement in their lives, but they should wish for good things first - after all, excitement isn't always good."
 VIETold.2005.b.tooltip:0 "Indeed, sometimes people always sit around and don't do anything with their lives. What's the purpose of living if you don't explore the world?"
 VIETold.2006.t:0 "Watchman's Ease"
 VIETold.2006.desc:0 ""Top of the morning and nothing to report," the guard told me as I made a few rounds around my garden."
 VIETold.2006.a:0 "Continue as you were."
 VIETold.2006.b:0 "Stand up straight!"
 VIETold.2006.c:0 "Why aren't you being more vigilant?"
 VIETold.2007.t:0 "Glory of Earth"
 VIETold.2007.desc:0 "There are of course always those who doubt my right to rule this land and claim I am not its rightful ruler. Yet how can I gaze upon this land of mine, and not see my connection to it? It is my realm too. I have a purpose as its master:"
 VIETold.2007.a:0 "To.... Actually, I'm not too sure what my purpose is."
 VIETold.2007.b:0 "To do with it as I please."
 VIETold.2007.c:0 "To protect and help my subjects."
 VIETold.2007.d:0 "To bring glory to my realm and dynasty."
 VIETold.2008.t:0 "Minstrel's Lament"
 VIETold.2008.desc:0 "A musician I hired for a banquet sings a rather sad song. Many in my court are moved deeply by the pathos of the story being told."
 VIETold.2008.a:0 "I, too, shed a tear."
 VIETold.2008.b:0 "I didn't find it that sad."
 VIETold.2009.t:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]'s Ascension"
 VIETold.2009.desc:0 "A physical manifestation of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] supposedly appeared in a village nearby, and blessed a few locals, before ascending into the heavens. Few of the official clergy seem to believe these peasants' claims, saying it is misunderstandings of the ignorant, but the peasants don't care and have built altars where these incidents occurred."
 VIETold.2009.a:0 "A good omen! Encourage the clergy to support the village."
 VIETold.2009.b:0 "It was clearly an illusion of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]. Repress the cult!"
 VIETold.2009.c:0 "I have no opinion on these peasants' superstitions."
 VIETold.2010.t:0 "Dusk at the Market"
 VIETold.2010.desc:0 "I rushed to the local market as the sun was setting, hoping to buy something I really wanted, but the merchant told me he had all run out of that product.\n\n"It will be a long time before I can acquire more of it," he told me apologetically.\n\nEven if I were to pay him a lot of money, he won't be able to get it for me right now."
 VIETold.2010.a:0 "No problem with that! I will wait."
 VIETold.2010.b:0 "That bastard! He's tricking me!"
 VIETold.2010.c:0 "At least he's honest. Can't do much now."
 VIETold.2011.t:0 "Sunrise of Flutes"
 VIETold.2011.desc:0 "Today I woke up earlier than usual.\n\nFeeling a bit restless, I ventured out of my residence and took a walk outside with some trusted guards.We thought we heard a whistling sound up ahead, and upon further investigation we found out that it was a young shepherd with his flock, playing a pleasant song on his wooden flute.\n\nHe greeted me reverently, and wished me the best."
 VIETold.2011.a:0 "Please, play some more music. It's good."
 VIETold.2011.b:0 "He's just a peasant."
 VIETold.2012.t:0 "Peace of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 VIETold.2012.desc:0 "There are those who say that according to our divine scriptures, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] wants all peoples to be at peace with one another. But is that just mere idealism? Can true peace under the wisdom and benevolence of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] ever be accomplished?"
 VIETold.2012.a:0 "I think [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] wants us to smite infidels, not to have peace!"
 VIETold.2012.b:0 "Love and peace! We are indeed all brothers and sisters!"
 VIETold.2012.c:0 "It's a nice idea, but idealism can only do so much."
 VIETold.2013.t:0 "Love Under Moon"
 VIETold.2013.desc:0 "The book I read looked like a typical vapid romance at first. Instead, it was an epic love story with drama, comedy and tragedy, that raised poignant, difficult questions about human morality and mortality. Immensely moved, I now find it hard to fall asleep at night as I think about the characters I'd grown to love and their bittersweet fates. Will I ever read a story like that again?"
 VIETold.2013.a:0 "I never expected to like that kind of story in the first place!"
 VIETold.2014.t:0 "A Simple Story"
 VIETold.2014.desc:0 "I was watching a play a traveling troupe was performing. Though it was a short and simple love story without much drama or conflict, the characters were likeable and realistic in their motivations and desires. Despite its simplicity and lack of tension, many in the audience loved the story."
 VIETold.2014.a:0 "Those plebians - it's just some banal fluff!"
 VIETold.2014.b:0 "I admit, it brought a smile to my face."
 VIETold.2015.t:0 "Bad History"
 VIETold.2015.desc:0 "A poet is reciting a tale about a historical event long ago before me and an audience. I realize he just made a mistake, and there are some inaccuracies in his retelling of what happened!\n\nPerhaps I should do my duty and inform this poet that his knowledge of the past is faulty, and will cause others to misunderstand those who came before us. On the other hand, maybe people will misinterpret my good intentions as haughtiness. What to do...?"
 VIETold.2015.a:0 "Don't say anything. I don't need people thinking I'm smug."
 VIETold.2015.b:0 "Correct him - history should not be lies!"
 VIETold.2015.c:0 "Correct him - the true history is more interesting."
 VIETold.2015.d:0 "Correct him - I want to show off my knowledge."
 VIETold.2016.t:0 "Visions of the Past"
 VIETold.2016.desc:0 "I was idly reading a book about historical events in ancient times. Suddenly, when I came across a particular section, disjointed images and scenes flashed before my mind, as if I was really there. My servants found me on the ground moments later, having fainted. They were skeptical when I described what happened, but the feelings of sadness, joy, hatred, love - I felt all that!"
 VIETold.2016.a:0 "Was I really there, in the past? Why am I here now?"
 VIETold.2017.t:0 "Deeds of Heroes"
 VIETold.2017.desc:0 "I recently took the time to read through various books explaining the exploits and deeds of ancient heroes and warriors. It was informative, and helped me to better understand:"
 VIETold.2017.a:0 "Which tactics and strategies work, and which ones don't."
 VIETold.2017.b:0 "What makes a person brave and able to fight the odds."
 VIETold.2017.c:0 "How to uphold justice and righteousness among all."
 VIETold.2018.t:0 "A Simple Love Story"
 VIETold.2018.desc:0 "I recently read a touching story about a pure-hearted romance between a young man and woman who had grown up as neighbors and friends. Their virtue and honesty helped them ensure many hardships so they could be united in marriage."
 VIETold.2018.a:0 "I hate stupid love stories. Why did I read that?"
 VIETold.2018.b:0 "It was an adorable tale about true love."
 VIETold.2019.t:0 "Outside"
 VIETold.2019.desc:0 "I sit at the windowsill, staring outside. What do I see far away that I observe with great scrutiny?"
 VIETold.2019.a:0 "Nature's somber awe - plants, the skies, the sun before me."
 VIETold.2019.b:0 "A group of peasant children playing games outside."
 VIETold.2019.c:0 "Some of my guardsmen marching around on patrol."
 VIETold.2019.d:0 "Someone very attractive passing through."
 VIETold.2020.t:0 "Stuck at Home"
 VIETold.2020.desc:0 "In my dream, I live in a large mansion of unrivaled beauty, so vast it could not have been built by mundane means. It is a gorgeous residence where I have all the comforts of home - food, drink, and entertainment at my beck and call, and all manner of exotic mechanical and magical contraptions. And yet I am trapped. Every time I try to escape, I end up coming back, somehow!"
 VIETold.2020.a:0 "This is no way to live! I must be free!"
 VIETold.2020.b:0 "Since it is here before me, I guess I can enjoy it."
 VIETold.2020.c:0 "Only fools take for granted the gifts they're given."
 VIETold.2021.t:0 "The Ghost At Home"
 VIETold.2021.desc:0 "I pass by a small ancient ruin while traveling through a village. The peasant acting as your guide tells me of a local folk legend, that centuries ago when a plague struck the area, one of the locals holed himself up in the ruin - as it was his house back then - and died there by himself when he ran out of food and drink. His lonely spirit, supposedly, still haunts the area to this day."
 VIETold.2021.a:0 "An interesting tale, I suppose!"
 VIETold.2022.t:0 "In the Way"
 VIETold.2022.desc:0 "I am pacing back and forth inside my residence, thinking about this or that, and then I accidentally bump into some of the furniture."
 VIETold.2022.a:0 "Whoops! Silly me!"
 #VIETold.2022.message:0 "You hurt yourself bumping into furniture"
 VIETold.2023.t:0 "Eek!"
 VIETold.2023.desc:0 "Some of my young maidservants screamed in terror when a mouse scurried past us one morning. The mouse was nowhere to be found after a quick search, but some of the girls are still scared and worry there may be more mice at my home."
 VIETold.2023.a:0 "Poor children. Worry not, the mouse is gone!"
 VIETold.2023.b:0 "Come on now. Grow up already, be a little brave!"
 VIETold.2023.c:0 "The mice are our brothers and sisters, we should respect them."
 VIETold.2023.d:0 "A worrisome sight! We must remain vigilant."
 VIETold.2024.t:0 "In Flagrante"
 VIETold.2024.desc:0 "I was bored at home with nothing to do one day, so I decided to take a walk around when I overheard some muffled sounds coming from a room. I snuck over and opened the door slightly, and peeked inside. One of my maids and one of my manservants were making love and in the throes of passion, oblivious to the world around them! Though young, they should know better."
 VIETold.2024.a:0 "Barge in and order them to stop doing this in public."
 VIETold.2024.b:0 "Secretly watch them eagerly but don't tell them."
 VIETold.2024.c:0 "Forget it - it is none of my business."
 VIETold.2024.d:0 "Tell them later they have my blessing to marry."
 VIETold.2025.t:0 "Boom!"
 VIETold.2025.desc:0 "A loud noise is heard outside and on instinct I rush to the window, curious. I look out and see nothing out of the ordinary."
 VIETold.2025.a:0 "Odd. Is my imagination playing tricks on me?"
 VIETold.2026.t:0 "Night Owl"
 VIETold.2026.desc:0 "I've been staying up a lot lately out of boredom."
 VIETold.2026.a:0 "It's not a healthy thing, but I can't resist."
 VIETold.2026.b:0 "I'll try to make the most of my bad habit."
 VIETold.2027.t:0 "Deviant Lands"
 VIETold.2027.desc:0 "I have heard that there are lands far away from where I live, where the practice of marriage between siblings is common and not just accepted, but actively embraced and encouraged throughout society, from the highest of royalty to the humblest of peasants. Could such communities even exist? If they did, I have yet to meet anyone from such a place in person - or at least anyone whose story I would believe."
 VIETold.2027.a:0 "If such people existed, then they're absolutely barbaric! Degenerates, all of them!"
 VIETold.2027.b:0 "Who am I to judge? Different people have different customs and traditions."
 VIETold.2027.c:0 "Thinking about them gets me all excited. #EMP Very#! excited."
 VIETold.2027.d:0 "All of these rumors are fanciful tales made up by perverts without sisters."
 VIETold.2028.t:0 "Flying Rabbits?"
 VIETold.2028.desc:0 ""Have you heard of the flying rabbits of the far north?" my servant asks me one day, while we are conversing about various matters. "Fascinating creatures! Do you think they're real?""
 VIETold.2028.a:0 "Don't be silly. Rabbits don't fly, nor live in the frozen north."
 VIETold.2028.b:0 "Who knows? It's certainly a possibility!"
 VIETold.2028.c:0 "You're confusing them with a real creature known as the..."
 VIETold.2029.t:0 "The Last Egyptians"
 VIETold.2029.desc:0 "A traveler is regaling me with a tale he heard when he was visiting a town along the Nile one day. "I was told that during Roman times, Egypt's governor sent a trusted friend and advisor as a diplomat to the southern lands of Ethiopia, but he got lost in the desert not too far from where I stayed. He finally found a large oasis, where people still behaved like the ancient Egyptians, building pyramids and worshipping ancient gods, and they had no knowledge of how the Nile had been conquered by first the Hellenes and then the Romans.""
 VIETold.2029.a:0 "That a community would keep alive such ancient customs!" 
 VIETold.2029.b:0 "I'm sure they were merely some troglodytic peasants." 
 VIETold.2029.c:0 "Would these hidden oases still be around today?" 
 VIETold.2030.t:0 "The Fabled Eastern Islands"
 VIETold.2030.desc:0 ""Ah! Let me tell you a story," the merchant says, after we finish with business. Not one to anger my jolly guest, we sit down as we feast and he tells me what he heard when he visited China not too long ago. "I was told that if one sails east, beyond even the fabled isles of Cipangu, one would eventually reach a large island ruled by towering men who ride steeds of solid gold. These people of the Sun are most intelligent and mighty and ruled by an immortal dragon.""
 VIETold.2030.a:0 "Fascinating people! Maybe one day we'll meet them."
 VIETold.2030.b:0 "I'm not convinced they exist."
 VIETold.2031.t:0 "Opposite Land"
 VIETold.2031.desc:0 "An acquaintance tells me that she heard if one digs underground deep enough, one will emerge in another world where there are people similar to ours. However, they are the opposite of us - their women are taller than their men, the men stay at home and manage domestic affairs while the women fight wars, and most scandalously, siblings can wed one another. Still, my acquaintance said she heard this land was mostly peaceful and prosperous."
 VIETold.2031.a:0 "Perhaps their strange ways are why they're prosperous and peaceful."
 VIETold.2031.b:0 "Really now! How could a society like that possibly exist?"
 VIETold.2031.c:0 "How exciting! My imagination is trying to envision such a place."
 VIETold.2032.t:0 "Tale of the Labyrinth"
 VIETold.2032.desc:0 "Someone tells me of a king in a faraway land who was cruel, yet fair in his dealings.\n\nOnce, he hired an engineer to create the largest labyrinth the world has ever known. Those guilty of the worst crimes were put in this maze of tunnels and hallways, which were filled with all manner of violent beasts, as well as dangerous booby traps that could kill a man instantly. Almost none escaped, but there were always a few who had the wits and tenacity - or perhaps the luck and blessings of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] - to find their way out, and the king granted freedom to these few for their impressive achievement."
 VIETold.2032.a:0 "Someone capable enough to escape deserves freedom, yes."
 VIETold.2032.b:0 "A strange ruler! Such unnecessary and outlandish methods."
 VIETold.2032.c:0 "I hoped his labyrinth had many of those monsters and death traps!"
 VIETold.2033.t:0 "Guardian of the Gate"
 VIETold.2033.desc:0 "I have heard rumors about a noble and valiant warrior woman in a distant land, who is immortal and stands guard over an ancient gate made of marble and obsidian. Those who best her in combat will be allowed into the gate, which is a portal to a heavenly paradise, a most peaceful and pastoral landscape one can live in with no worries nor fears.\n\nIf it did exist, could I go there?"
 VIETold.2033.a:0 "If only I could go to such a place, I'd be so happy."
 VIETold.2033.b:0 "I'm sure I could beat that woman and gain entry."

 VIETold.2034.t:0 "A Dream of Danger"
 VIETold.2034.desc:0 "I meet a local village elder, a wizened old man, who was a foolhardy adventurer in his youth. He once got lost in a great forest, and almost drowned in its swamps. Fortunately, he was rescued by a mysterious man, who was of tall and handsome appearance, and carried himself in a calm and kind yet melancholy, somber, regal manner. This man referred to himself only as a dreamer, and warned about the seductive dangers of excitement and risk.\n\nAfterwards, the old man never sought out reckless excitement again, and lived a stable, quiet, happy life back home."
 VIETold.2034.a:0 "Agreed! Only idiots blindly worship excitement and ambition."
 VIETold.2034.b:0 "I disagree. What's the point of living a boring life?"
 VIETold.2034.c:0 "Wait a moment... did you meet the #EMP Dreamer#!?"
 VIETold.2035.t:0 "The Immortal Horse"
 VIETold.2035.desc:0 "Among the nomad peoples of Eurasia, there are stories of an immortal horse, forever racing across the great steppes, free and bold. The galloping of the mighty steed's hooves sound like thunder, and it is faster than anything one could see."
 VIETold.2035.a:0 "Maybe one day I shall see it!"
 VIETold.2035.b:0 "A fanciful tale, nothing more."
 VIETold.2036.t:0 "Woman in White"
 VIETold.2036.desc:0 "I have a guard who once visited a distant village by a forest, said to be a gateway to the world beyond. While there, he went in the forest despite the locals' warning.\n\nIn the forest, he encountered a pale maiden wearing a white dress. Though she was charming and bashful, there was something off about her; the tone of her voice was odd, and her dress fluttered in the wind in a strange way. Frightened out of his wits, he fled immediately, knowing she must have been an evil spirit of some sort.\n\nAccording to locals from that area, not only are such sightings common in the forest, but many have also mysteriously died or disappeared there."
 VIETold.2036.a:0 "What a coward! She couldn't have been a spirit."
 VIETold.2036.b:0 "Frightening things lie beyond the fringes of civilization!"
 VIETold.2036.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The lady or woman in white is a type of spirit who appears in various folklores and mythologies around the world since ancient times. Oftentimes, she is the ghost of who died in tragic circumstances - perhaps in childbirth, or after her lover died, and so on. Sometimes she is a vengeful spirit who lures and attacks innocents; other times, she punishes the wicked, like adulterers."
 VIETold.2037.t:0 "A Dream of a Protector"
 VIETold.2037.desc:0 "My new maid is a strange woman. Her father was a merchant, and she often accompanied him on his journeys as child.\n\nShe claims when she was little, on one such journey, she and her father visited a forested land when she got lost in the woods at night. She was frightened, of course, and thought she would die.\n\nA mysterious woman found her sobbing, and guided her back to the main road. The woman was of tall and beautiful appearance, and carried herself in a friendly and serene, yet melancholy, somber, queenly manner. She barely spoke and before she disappeared, merely said she was a dreamer.\n\nTo this day, my servant wonders who her mysterious savior was."
 VIETold.2037.a:0 "A strange encounter!"
 VIETold.2037.b:0 "Wait - you met the #EMP Dreamer#!, didn't you!?!?"
 VIETold.2038.t:0 "The Scholar's Tale"
 VIETold.2038.desc:0 "I am hosting a prominent local scholar. Contrary to my expectations of him being an awkward, doddering old man, he is a tall, handsome, and charismatic young man. I see my maids and some of the noblewomen gazing upon him with an amusing hunger in their eyes as he recounts his many adventures with his soothing, deep voice.\n\nIn one of his anecdotes, he recalls the time he came across a large lake in my realm. He once visited it, but almost drowned when he tried taking a swim. When he came to, he found himself on one of the lake's islands he never saw before. As he describes its geography, I do not recall the existence of such a lake on such an island either."
 VIETold.2038.a:0 "What happened next?"
 VIETold.2039.tooltip:0 "This is all very mysterious!"
 VIETold.2039.t:0 "The Scholar's Tale"
 VIETold.2039.desc:0 "The scholar circled the shore of the island and came across an old temple built by the ancients, yet still in good condition despite being abandoned. There, he quickly prayed to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. Afterwards, to his surprise, he found a small boat near the temple which he used to leave the island.\n\nEvery time he returned to the lake, he could never find the island again. No one has heard of an island on that lake with its characteristics and geography, and it isn't mentioned in local legends, and his fellow scholars have not found a trace of it in historical records. However, we're all sure he isn't lying, as he is a respected scholar after all."
 VIETold.2039.a:0 "There must have been something strange afoot. Otherworldly beings?"
 VIETold.2039.b:0 "Perhaps the whole thing was a dream?"
 VIETold.2039.c:0 "Will I find the island one day? Who knows what secrets it holds!"
 VIETold.2040.t:0 "Isle of Colors"
 VIETold.2040.desc:0 "I appear to have interrupted a heated debate. A few of my courtiers and servants have been discussing rumors they heard about a distant land known as the Isle of Colors, where men and women are like us, except for one thing: their skin is an unnatural color. What my courtiers cannot seem to agree on, however, is what that skin color is. Perhaps I can provide my input on the matter?"
 VIETold.2040.a:0 "The Isle of Colors can't really exist - a tale that's made up, I truly insist!"
 VIETold.2040.b:0 "Their skin's true color is pink... at least, that is what I think."
 VIETold.2040.c:0 "I'd have to say surely dark blue is their skin's natural hue!"
 VIETold.2040.d:0 "I'd guess their skin is green, though this I have not seen."
 VIETold.2040.e:0 "I don't know the answer - this truth I can't infer."

 VIETold.2041.t:0 "Blood and Iron"
 VIETold.2041.desc:0 "In my dreams I find myself a soldier in a world torn asunder. Ash and smoke fill the skies as I stand in a muddy trench, wearing outlandishly shaped, long robes. I glance around and see other men dressed the same way, and conclude this is a uniform of some sort. Nearby, I hear loud noises, like as if thousands of buildings were collapsing, so I cover my ears and close my eyes."
 VIETold.2041.a:0 "It doesn't really help much, though."
 VIETold.2042.t:0 "No Man's Land"
 VIETold.2042.desc:0 "Fearfully, I glance over the trench and see nothing but black mud at first. On the ground from one end of the horizon to another are stone-cold corpses with open eyes and still-bleeding wounds. Suddenly, another loud crash, this one closer.\n\nAs men around me begin to shout words I don't know, I see other soldiers grasping their weapons, which are strange, hollowed spears with crooked handles. I do understand, despite my terrified state, that I am to go over the muddy trench I am currently in and charge at some enemy on the other side. I duly grasp my hollow spear and follow the others over the trench."
 VIETold.2042.a:0 "Wait, what was that? Ahhh!"
 VIETold.2043.t:0 "A World at War"
 VIETold.2043.desc:0 "I scream as I see metallic horses and birds the size of houses swoop around me, while loud explosions rock everywhere. Men fall down like paper burned by a never-ending inferno, from flying pebbles that tear them to pieces. Others are blown to pieces as thunder strikes seemingly arbitrary places on the ground.\n\nThis is the future of humanity, I realize: there is no future, no hope. This is the war to end all wars, that the world shall end in an apocalypse of fire and hatred.\n\nI wake up, sweating. Was that a vision of the future? Surely not. But if it was... how much longer until our descendants witness such horrors? A century from now? Two centuries? Ten?"
 VIETold.2043.a:0 "I lie back down and try to sleep, but can't."
 VIETold.2044.t:0 "From the Steppes"
 VIETold.2044.desc:0 "There have been many nomad empires, some quite large and some quite small. But today I have met an elderly wise woman and self-proclaimed seer who says we have yet to see the greatest of these empires. She says in the not too distant future, a great conqueror shall come from the steppes and destroy all the kingdoms and empires in his path, if not the entire world.\n\nHa! As if that'd happen."
 VIETold.2044.a:0 "Many nomad hordes come and go, what would make this one any different?"
 VIETold.2045.t:0 "Scourge of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 VIETold.2045.desc:0 "This lord shall be born grasping a blood clot in his fist, the seer proclaims, and his mighty warriors shall pour forth from the steppes like water flows down a river and wash the world in blood and death.\n\nShe laughs at my doubt, and says in a chilling tone: "This man, this instrument of war, this instrument of the divine is not to be trifled with, for he is the very fist of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to punish all for their wickedness. By his arrows, the Jade Dragon to the east shall perish. Under the hooves of his riders, the Rajas of India shall fall one by one. Against his dark armor, forged from the very sins of mankind, even the fearsome Sword of Islam and the Crusader Kings will do naught but a scratch to this bloodied messenger of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].""
 VIETold.2045.a:0 "Ha! The Jade Dragon cannot possibly fall."
 VIETold.2045.b:0 "The Rajas of India can fight such a monster!"
 VIETold.2045.c:0 "He sounds scary, but the Sword of Islam is stronger."
 VIETold.2045.d:0 "Surely the Crusader Kings will have the zeal to resist!"
 VIETold.2045.e:0 "They said similar things about Attila - where are the Huns now?"
 VIETold.2046.t:0 "Fork in the Road"
 VIETold.2046.desc:0 "I am asleep and wandering the void before my mind is pulled into a dream. Deep in my subconsciousness, I know this as a vision of the future, though my consciousness doesn't register it as such. There is a fork at the road - at least, I think it is a road, and I think it is a fork at a road - that goes in two directions."
 VIETold.2046.a:0 "Left"
 VIETold.2046.b:0 "Right"
 VIETold.2047.t:0 "A Curse?"
 VIETold.2047.desc:0 "I see nothing but fire and brimstone. Gone is all hope! Gone is the future of my dynasty and my realm! All has been destroyed by our enemies and the will of the heavens."
 VIETold.2047.a:0 "Is this our fate? It can't be!"
 VIETold.2048.t:0 "A Blessing?"
 VIETold.2048.desc:0 "I see an idyllic landscape as far as the horizon stretches. The sky is bright, the sun is warm, the birds are singing. In this world, my dynasty and my realm prosper."
 VIETold.2048.a:0 "It would be good if this came true."
 VIETold.2049.t:0 "The Seer"
 VIETold.2049.desc:0 "A traveling seer is visiting my court today. She is a strange one, sometimes staring into space and saying nothing in the middle of a chat, other times speaking in tongues. But when given some food, she seems to enter a trance. We all watch her, uncertain. It begins with some undecipherable mumbles, but soon becomes comprehensible speech.\n\nWait - what is... what is she saying?"
 VIETold.2049.a:0 "Shh! Listen to what she's saying!"
 VIETold.2050.t:0 "The Prophecy"
 VIETold.2050.desc:0 "The seer's words are a chilling prophecy: "A holy fury from the Sons of Abraham shall descend into our land and kill the old gods." She continues, ranting about how our ancient ways are in grave danger before collapsing and falling asleep. When she wakes up, she doesn't recall anything she said."
 VIETold.2050.a:0 "That was a lunatic's rant - the old gods are strong!"
 VIETold.2050.b:0 "We must prepare to protect ourselves from this holy fury!"
 VIETold.2050.c:0 "The Sons of Abraham are mighty, this is simply our fate."
 VIETold.2051.t:0 "The End is Nigh!"
 VIETold.2051.desc:0 "I thought he was the town beggar screaming nonsense at first. When I asked some locals however, they explained he was actually a deranged lunatic who believed the end times were coming."
 VIETold.2051.a:0 "Ah, yes, so the usual sort of raving madman. Carry on."
 VIETold.2051.b:0 "Why, the end of the world IS coming soon!"
 VIETold.2052.t:0 "Coming Doom?"
 VIETold.2052.desc:0 "I had a nightmare that began innocently. At first, I was talking to a beautiful young lady, who seemed most charming, but she transformed into the Whore of Babylon herself, and brought with her fire and death. She laughed as I tried to run away, before screaming in a shrill, demented voice that I nor my realm would escape a terrible fate!"
 VIETold.2052.a:0 "I awoke, frightened beyond my wits."
 VIETold.2053.t:0 "Past, Present, Future"
 VIETold.2053.desc:0 "I wonder if people in the past had the same sort of desires and thoughts I do. I then wonder if people in the future will be the same as me as well."
 VIETold.2053.a:0 "Definitely! At the end of the day we are all people."
 VIETold.2053.b:0 "No, people of the past and future are too different from me."
